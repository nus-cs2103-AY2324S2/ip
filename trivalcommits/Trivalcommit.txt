Find command is case-sensitive.

A case-insensitive find is more user-friendly because users cannot be

* add a script to migrate stress tests to the new format

make PR on code quality branch

C-help : 加个help command
C-undo : 给list 加个stack<ArrayList<Task>>
C-statistics : 给各个class加个static, 完成量, 未完成量
C-massOPs : 给各个command 加变异模式
