Add trival commit for full commit message

Find command is case-sensitive.

A case-insensitive find is more user-friendly because users cannot be

* add a script to migrate stress tests to the new format

make PR on code quality branch

C-BetterSearch is already fulfilled as I used regular expression for the find part at beginning.
