This is the greeting message which constructs the first message you should see when you run the file but sadly some characters might be lost in transmission :"
```
private  String greetingString() {
        String msg = "";
        msg += String.format("%30s", " （„• ֊ •„)♡\n");
        msg += "heyo! my name is ✦" + this.name + "✦\n";
        msg += "What would you like for me to do???\n";
        return msg;
    }
```
