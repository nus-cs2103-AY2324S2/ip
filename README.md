## *For Java Programmers*

If you are a Java programmer, you can use Skyler to practice Java too. Here's the main method:

```java
public class Main extends Application {

    private Skyler skyler = new Skyler();

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) {
        try {
            FXMLLoader fxmlLoader = new FXMLLoader(Main.class.getResource("/view/MainWindow.fxml"));
            AnchorPane ap = fxmlLoader.load();
            Scene scene = new Scene(ap);
            stage.setScene(scene);
            fxmlLoader.<MainWindow>getController().setSkyler(skyler);
            stage.setTitle("Skyler");
            stage.show();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
