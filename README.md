## Features
> [!NOTE]
> - Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
> - All parameters are mandatory. Commands with parameters that are in the wrong format (e.g. wrong order, empty parameters, additional parameters) will cause an error.
> - Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as list and exit) will be ignored.
e.g. if the command specifies list 123, it will be interpreted as list.
