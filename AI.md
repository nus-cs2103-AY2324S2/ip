I used Copilot for code and JavaDoc generation. 
I used it from increment 7 onwards. It saved about 30% of the time I would have spent on writing code and JavaDoc.
(the previous sentence was also generated by AI ðŸ™‚)

I spent about 7 hours a week on this project, across 5 weeks. So, this translates to 

$$0.3 \times (5 \times 7) = 10.5$$ 

hours saved, which is a lot! Of course, minus off the time spent setting it up, 
which was unfortunately more than it should have been.
