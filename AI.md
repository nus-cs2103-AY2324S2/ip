## Productivity observation with AI assist

Using github copilot for autocomplete

### Performance
Does best when the structure of the top level codes are there,
hence providing a better context for the AI to work with.

When there is no structure yet, it has higher chance of hallucinating
the wrong code.

It is also a 60-40 mix of good and bad suggestions, sometimes the details are inaccurate.

If you have coded similar function before, it will be able to suggest the right code when repeated.
Thus, it is better with laborous tasks with certain existing code for better code suggestions.

Personally think that it saves some time by helping you type similar code again 
or very trivial next few steps that you expect to take.

### Benefits
Helps to reduce cognitive load of typing and thinking of the variable names.
Speed up refactoring of code when shifting to more OOP, and it will consider the
Original code written to suggest the right code in new classes.
Speeds up writing comments with similar code and contexts. Though it is not detailed at times,
I can speed up the obvious parts and add on with more important details.


### Limitations
Sometimes it is not able to suggest the right code, and you have to manually type it out.
Sometimes it does not suggest everything previously written, so similar bugs might appear again.
