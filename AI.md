# Tools Used

I primarily used ChatGPT, and only for Javadocs generation (as I preferred to write the code myself, and Javadocs is a tedious enough task that can be done well by ChatGPT).

It saved me a good one hour or so, as I just had to provide my functions and it would generate the accurate Javadoc for me.
