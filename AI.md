# Use of AI in this project

Ai was used mainly in the form of Github Copilot. 
It was used to generate the code for the project. 
It was also used to generate the documentation for the project. Copilot was very helpful for writing boilerplate code
and for writing documentation. In terms of concrete logic, it sometimes failed / generated code which was not useful / 
very wrong. However, it really did speed up a lot of the process of writing this project. Not only that, if you were 
stuck on a problem, it was very helpful to generate some code to get you started.
