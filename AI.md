# Using AI

When starting on fluffy in week 2,
I wanted to try to learn how to effectively use
GitHub CoPilot to help me write code.

I had heard about it from a friend and was curious
to see how it would work.

Some of the main things I used CoPilot for were:
- Implementing behaviour of methods from method names
- Writing JavaDoc comments
- Writing skeletal code for classes
- Refactoring long methods into smaller ones
- Writing test cases

For many of these, CoPilot would be able to get the
gist of what I wanted to do, but would assume things
like method names and variable names. These were
usually easy to change, but it also served as a
reminder of what methods I should have in my class.

CoPilot has made the process of documenting my code
much more efficient.

I spent a considerable amount of time thinking about
designing behaviour of classes and methods, but when
it came to actual typing,
I would say 75% of characters in this project was
written by CoPilot. (Including this Markdown file!)
