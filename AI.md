## Productivity observation with AI assist

Using github copilot for autocomplete

### Performance
Does best when the structure of the top level codes are there,
hence providing a better context for the AI to work with.

When there is no structure yet, it has higher chance of hallucinating
the wrong code.

It is also a 60-40 mix of good and bad suggestions, sometimes the details are inaccurate.

If you have coded similar function before, it will be able to suggest the right code when repeated.
Thus, it is better with laborous tasks with certain existing code for better code suggestions.

Personally think that it saves some time by helping you type similar code again 
or very trivial next few steps that you expect to take.
