## Tools Used
GitHub Co-Pilot

## Observations
1. Co-Pilot is particularly useful when writing boilerplate code. For instance, when creating the error messages for each case, having written the first one, Co-Pilot was able to generate the rest of the error messages for the other cases. 

## Time Saved
50% less time was spent on writing code.
