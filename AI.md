Used GitHub Copilot to generate documentation for the project. 
It was good for boilerplate explanations, but not for more complex topics.
It did not follow the Java coding standard specified by the course, so I had to manually modify the generated documentation.

From Week 4 onwards, I also regularly used GitHub Copilot to generate code for the project.
