Week 3 kokbot.task:
- Using github copilot for:
    - Level 7

          - If invalid suggestions are lazily taken, productivity actually reduces in the long-term
    - Level 8
      - \+ extremely useful in coming up with suitable datetime patterns
      - \+ kind of insane how good it is at predicting what i am going to type.. almost a little creepy ngl lol
