Chatgpt was used for the following increments
- A-Streams
  - Worked pretty well at replacing the original code which used lists into streams, I think it was good that all the logic was kept in a single folder, so other than just renaming some conventions/functions the code didnt break massively.
- A-Personality
  - Used simply to generate the texts.
- A-BetterGui
  - Chatgpt wasnt very helpful in this case because I guess its difficult to describe how youw want your UI to look like to a chatbot and expect a good result, I think also the fact that the files were separated makes it a little harder for the bot to give good results.
