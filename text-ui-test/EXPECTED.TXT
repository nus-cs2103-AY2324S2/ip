Oopses daisy!
 It seems like you might have forgotten to give an argument for the unmark command.
 Don't worry, it happens to most of us.
 Just add the index for the task you'd like to unmark, and you'll be all set.
 Please try again, or type 'bye' to exit.

Whoopsie!
 It seems like you may have forgotten to write the deadline time.
____________________________________________________________

Whoopsie! It seems like you may have forgotten to write the deadline time or didn't use ' /by ' in your command.
 Remember there is a space before and after '/by'.
 It's a tiny detail, but oh so important! Just add the deadline after '/by ', and you'll be as organized as a library on a quiet morning.
 You're doing an amazing job!

As our time together comes to a close, I just want to say it's been an absolute delight!
 Remember, every day is a new adventure waiting to happen.
 Bye for now, and take care!
