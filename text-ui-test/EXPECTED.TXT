[quack] I don't understand that command. If you would like to add a task to the Duckalendar,
 please specify with the task type - "todo", "deadline" or "event" followed by a space in front of the task name.
 For deadlines, please add a /by followed by the deadline (eg. /by Monday) . For events, please add a / followed by the start time, then another / followed by the end time.
