/**
* Represents a simple chatbot application called Anna.
*
* Anna is designed to handle and manage tasks through a command-line interface.
* It utilizes a {@link TaskList} to manage tasks, interacts with the user through a
* {@link Ui} for input/output, and persists task data using a {@link Storage} object.
*
* The main functionality of Anna involves processing user commands to perform various
* operations on the task list, such as adding, deleting, and marking tasks as done.
*
* The chatbot's behavior is encapsulated within the {@code run} method, where it
* initializes the necessary components, greets the user, and enters a loop to handle
* user commands until the user decides to exit.
*
