# Maltese User Guide üêï

## Set up
- Ensure you have Java 11 installed in your computer
- Open up your terminal and locate the maltese.jar file
- Enter `java -jar maltese.jar`
- As this is your first time setting up, there is a high chance that you might encounter these error messages
  
  ```
  WARNING: Unsupported JavaFX configuration: classes were loaded from 'unnamed module @5b2ba064'
  File not found: ./data/tasks.txt
  Creating the file...
  Sorry ./data/tasks.txt (No such file or directory)
  Error loading data from file.
  ```
  
  You may choose to ignore these error messages as **Maltese will still run as intended**.
  On subsequent runs, however, you should only encounter this error message as by now, your directory should contain ./data/tasks.txt
