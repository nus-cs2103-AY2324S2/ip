# Working with Oak-Dex

This section introduces how **you** can work with Oak-Dex! 

Note that 'Tasks' refer to Todos, Events and Deadlines.

## Adding Tasks

```

### Deadlines

Adds a new Deadline Item, called 'CS2103 Assignment', which is due by 23rd February 2024 (`2024-03-23`), 2359 (`23:59`)

```

```
## Listing Tasks

Lists all tasks currently stored in Oak-Dex, regardless of if they are marked as completed.

Syntax: `list`

Example Output:
```
1. [T][ ] CS2103 Week 6 Quiz
2. [E][ ] lecture (from: 01 12 2024 @ 1000 to: 01 12 2024 @ 1200)
3. [D][ ] CS2103 Assignment (by: 23 02 2024 @ 2359)
```

## Deleting Tasks

Deletes a Task (Event, Todo or Deadline) from Oak-Dex using the `taskId` as an identifier.
To find the appropriate `taskId` for the task you wish to delete, use the `list` command.
See [here](#listing-tasks-) for more information on the `list` command.

Syntax: `delete <taskId>`

Example: `delete 1`

Deletes the Task with the `taskId` 1. 

```
Are you giving up? Or is this task no longer needed?
Hmmmm.. I've deleted Task 1 for now.
But, I'll be watching you.
```

## Marking Tasks

Marks a Task (Event, Todo or Deadline) from Oak-Dex as completed, using the `taskId` as an identifier.
To find the appropriate `taskId` for the task you wish to mark, use the `list` command.
See [here](#listing-tasks-) for more information on the `list` command.

Syntax: `mark <taskId>`

Example: `mark 1`

Marks the Task with the `taskId` 1 as completed

```
Ok! I've marked Task 1 as completed!
```

## Unmarking Tasks

Unmarks a Task (Event, Todo or Deadline) from Oak-Dex as not completed, using the `taskId` as an identifier.
To find the appropriate `taskId` for the task you wish to unmark, use the `list` command.
See [here](#listing-tasks-) for more information on the `list` command.

Syntax: `unmark <taskId>`

Example: `unmark 1`

Unmarks the Task with the `taskId` 1 as completed, that is, removing the completed mark from the Task

```
Hmmm, were you teasing me?
Well, I've marked Task 1 as uncompleted,
But don't do this again, you hear me?
```

## Reminders

Lists all Events / Deadline Tasks for which the `to-datetime` and the `by-datetime` respectively is after the current System datetime.

Syntax: `reminder`

```
[E][ ] lecture (from: 01 12 2024 @ 1000 to: 01 12 2024 @ 1200)
[D][ ] CS2103 Assignment (by: 23 02 2024 @ 2359)
