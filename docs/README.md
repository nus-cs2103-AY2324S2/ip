## Finding Tasks

Riri allows you to find tasks in your task list based on keywords. Use the following format:

Example: `find books`

After entering this command, Riri will search your task list for tasks containing the keyword "books."

### Tips for Using Find

- The `find` command is not case-sensitive, so it will match tasks regardless of case.
- You can use partial keywords to broaden your search. For example, `find book` will match tasks with the word "book" in them.

Feel free to experiment with different keywords to quickly locate the tasks you are looking for.

## Deleting a task

In Riri, you have the ability to delete tasks from your task list.

Example: `delete 3`

This would result in the 3rd task in your task list to be deleted


## Saving tasks

Your task list is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.


## Exit program

We can exit the chatbot and save messages by writing `bye`

Example: `bye`

The chatbot will exit.
