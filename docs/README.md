## Features

### Notes about the command format

> [!TIP]
> - Words in `[]` are the parameters supplied by the user (omit these square brackets when you fill your own information)
    e.g. in `todo [DESCRIPTION]`, `[DESCRIPTION]` is a parameter which can be used as `todo read book`.
> - Commands with multiple parameters must be specified in the correct order.
  e.g. `event [DESCRIPTION] /from [DATE] /to [DATE]` must be specified in that exact order.
> - Dates must be in YYYY-MM-DD format
  e.g. 24th February 2024 is 2024-02-24
> - The symbol `|` cannot be used in any of the command descriptions.
