## Features <a id="features-anchor"></a>

>ℹ️ Notes about the command format:
>- words in upper `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
   e.g. in delete NUMBER, NUMBER is a parameter which can be used as delete 1.
>- Items in square brackets are optional.
   e.g todo [TODO] can be used as todo anything or as todo.
>- Extraneous parameters for commands (such as list, bye & sort) are allowed
   e.g. if the command specifies list 123, it will still execute the commands.
>- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and
   pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks
   >may be omitted when copied over to the application.
