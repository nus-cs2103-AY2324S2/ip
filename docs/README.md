# Features

Notes about command format:

1. words in [] are parameters to be input by users and must be empty.
   
   eg. `todo [content]`, content is a parameter which can be used as `todo read book`
       
2. Parameters have to be in the specified order.

3. Accepted DateTime format would be `yyyy-M-d Hmm` and `d/M/yyyy Hmm`.

   eg.`2024-2-25 1500` and `25/2/2024 1500` are accepted by the chatbot.
4. If the date passes the maximum date in that month, the largest date will be taken.
5. Index parameter follows the index in list. If you would like to know the index of the task
you would need to operate on check using `list`


## Adding Tasks
In general, you can add tasks by using the type of tasks to be added as the command. Newly added task will be added to 
the back of the tasklist.
Upon successful execution, a confirmation message will appear. 

Note that tasks in general contain two parameters:
* _Status_ of the task to indicate whether the task has been done
* _Content/Description_ of the task

Some types of tasks such as events and deadlines will have more parameters such as time, but every task type contains these two parameters.

## Exit: `bye`

## Saving tasks in a folder
By default, when you run the application, it will create a `data` folder in the home page if it does not exist.
Inside the `data` folder, it will create a `Bytetalker.txt` file. In this text file, all your tasks will be saved.
It is recommended not to touch this file. When you exit the program and rerun, the saved tasks in this file will be
automatically loaded into the list.
