# FishStock User Guide

<img src="Ui.png" width="400">

FishStock is a **desktop app for tracking tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having
the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, FishStock can get your task management done faster
than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start
1. Ensure you have **Java 11** installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest `fishstock.jar` from [here](https://github.com/bryanyee33/ip/releases).
3. Open a terminal within the folder you saved `fishstock.jar` in.
4. Type `java -jar fishstock.jar` into the terminal.
