### Editing the data file

The data is saved as a human-readable file in `[JAR file location]/data/save.txt`. 
Advanced users can modify the data file directly.

### Command Syntax

**Commands:**
Command refers to some text that a user can input, which results in the execution of some action,
and displays something in the chat. The execution can be either successful or unsuccessful (gives error message).
* `name` refers to a word, or a group of words, that are within brackets or after a forward slash.
    * The `name` at the start of a command refers to the name of the command.
* Square brackets (`[`, `]`) around an argument represents an **optional** argument, which does not have to be included.
* Angled brackets (`<`, `>`) around a `name` represents the name of the value of the argument.
* Forward slash `/` followed by a `name` represents the name of the argument.

**Arguments:**
Argument refers to some text that starts with a forward slash, followed by possibly brackets, in the command line.
* For example, in a deadline command, `/by today` is an argument with the name `by` and passes the value `today`.
  The name of the value is `by_date`.
* Arguments can be in **any** order, for example, `event cs2103t tutorial /to 2pm /from 1pm`.
* If the **same** argument is provided more than once, only the first instance of that argument is read.
  For example, in `deadline cs2103t quiz /by today /by tomorrow`, the `by_date` is read as `today`,
  and `tomorrow` is ignored.
* Invalid or missing arguments (and their values), will display an error to the user.
