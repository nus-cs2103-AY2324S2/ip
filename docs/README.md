Banter is an **app for managing tasks**, optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**, while still having 
the benefits of a **chat-bot Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. If you can type fast, Banter can get your tasks

## Quick start

2. Download the latest `banter.jar`

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` 
command to run the application. A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds.
