![Ui.png](Ui.png)

Sleepy is an **automated chatbot which helps you store your tasks - todos, deadlines, events
and plans**! It is **optimised for use for a Command Line Interface** (CLI) but still has a
basic Graphical User Interface (GUI).

# Quick Start
1. Ensure that you have Java `11` or above installed on your computer.
2. Download the latest sleepy.jar from [here
   ](https://github.com/kjw142857/ip/releases).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for Sleepy.
4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the java -jar sleepy.jar command to run the application.
   A GUI similar to the image at the top of this page should appear within seconds.
5. Type your command in the input box at the bottom of the screen. You can press Enter or
   click the `SEND HELP PLS` button to send your message.
   Some example commands you can try (not case-sensitive):
  * `list`: Lists all your tasks.
  * `todo sleep`: Adds a reminder for you to get some sleep.
  * `delete 7`: Deletes the 7th item in your task list.
  * `bye`: Exits the app after a short delay. 
6. Refer to the [User commands](#user-commands) below for details of each command.

# User commands


## Notes about the command format

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `todo DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which
  can be used, such as `todo sleep`.

* Parameters **must** be in the specified order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `event DESCRIPTION /from START_TIME /to END_TIME`,
  `event DESCRIPTION /to END_TIME /from START_TIME` is not recognised.

* For adding of tasks with one or more types of `TIME` (i.e. Plans, Deadline and Events), if
  any `TIME` is in `YYYY-MM-DD` format, it will automatically be converted for you
  to `DD-MMM-YYYY` format.
  For example, `event study /from 2023-01-26 /to next Wednesday` will be converted to
  `[E][ ] study (from: 26 Jan 2023 to: next Wednesday)`
