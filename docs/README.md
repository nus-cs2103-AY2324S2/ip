```

- Marking a completed task will effectively do nothing.

Examples:

```

```
...
I have maaarked the task as undone:
    [D][ ] User Guide
```

### Deleting a task: `delete`

Format: `delete INDEX`
- Deletes the task at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number<br> shown
in the **full** task list.

  Now you have 0 tasks in the list.
```
### Listing all tasks: `list`
Shows a list of all tasks.

Format: `list`
- Should not be followed by anything (even whitespaces!)

Examples:
- `list` after `todo User Guide` will result in the following:
```
Here aaaaare the taaaasks in your list:
    1. [T][ ] User Guide
```


### Locating tasks by descriptor: `find`
Finds tasks whose descriptions contain the given keyword.

Format: `find KEYWORD`
- The search is case-sensitive. e.g `uSeR` will not match `User`.
- Only the description is searched.
- Non-full words can be matched e.g `find er Gui` will match `User Guide`.
- Tasks with descriptions containing the keyword will be returned in list view.

Examples:
- `find user` returns nothing.
- `find er Gui` returns the `User Guide` task in the following format:

```
Here aaaaare the taaaasks in your list:
    1. [T][ ] User Guide
```

### Saving the data
Lamball saved task list and memo data are saved in the hard disk automatically after anyt command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file
Lamball data are saved as `.txt` files at:
- `[JAR File location]/src/main/java/data/list.txt` for Task list.
- `[JAR File location]/src/main/java/data/memo.txt` for Memo list.

‚ùó **Caution** If your changes to the data file makes the format invalid,<br>
Lamball will discard the invalid line at the next run.<br>
Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.

## FAQ
**Q:** Can I transfer my data to another computer?

**A:** Run the JAR file in another computer, and overwrite the empty data file<br>
it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Lamball home folder.
