## Date Time Formats
Yarr accepts the following formats for all commands that require date and time input:
- `dd/MM/yyyy HHmm` (e.g. 10/10/2024 1000)
- `dd-MM-yyyy HHmm` (e.g. 10-10-2024 1000)
- `ddMMyyyy HHmm` (e.g. 10102024 1000)

## Autosaving
Yarr automatically saves your tasks to a file called `yarr.txt` in a folder `data` in the directory as the program. There is no need to save manually.

### Data storage
If no suitable directory or file is found, Yarr will create the file and folder for you.
Subsequently launching the program will read the task list from said file.
