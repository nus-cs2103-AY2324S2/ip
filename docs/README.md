Here are the tasks in yoyr list: 
1.[T][] todo1 
2.[T][] todo2
```

The first bracket indicates the type of the task, T for todo, D for deadline
and E for event. The second bracket indicates whether the task is done,
if it is done, it would be marked by a cross.

## Deleting a task: `delete`

Deletes a task by the index on the task list.

Format: `delete INDEX`
