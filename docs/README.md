## Features

Here we explore all the features of **Homie!**

**Important notes about the features:**
- Words in curly braces `{}` and `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. e.g. in `todo
{TODO_DESCRIPTION}`, `{TODO_DESCRIPTION}` is a parameter which can be used as `todo read book`.
- Date Time formats specified in curly braces `{}` will not be in `UPPER_CASE` as they have their specified format. e.g.
`{dd MM yyyy HHmm}` as MM represents Month but mm represents minutes.
- Commands are **case-insensitive** but parameters are **case-sensitive**. e.g. both `todo read book` and `TODO read 
book` will add a new todo task named 'read book' while `todo read BOOK` will add a new todo task named 'read BOOK'.
- After adding or deleting a task, **Homie** will remind you of the number of tasks remaining in your task list.
- If the command requires a parameter, the parameter **CANNOT** be empty, and format has to be followed closely.
