# Klara User Guide

Klara is a desktop-app that tracks your tasks quickly and simply. It is optimised for text-based use, while 
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Typing fast can enable Klara to manage your tasks faster
than traditional GUI apps.

# Features
## Adding tasks
Klara offers three kinds of tasks you can add. They are:
* Todo
* Deadline
* Event

To add them, you can use the following commands:
* `todo {task name}` to add todo tasks.
* `deadline {task name} /by {yyyy-mm-dd}` to add deadlines.
* `event {task name} /from {yyyy-mm-dd} /to {yyyy-mm-dd}` to add events.

### Example `deadline` command
To specifically add a `deadline` task, you can use the command:
```
deadline finish 2103 assignment /by 2021-03-21
```

Klara will respond with:
```
Got it. I've added this task:
[D][ ] finish 2103 assignment (by: Mar 21 2021)
Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
```

## Viewing all tasks
To view all the tasks you have created, you can simply type the command `list`.

Depending on the tasks you have added, it will output differently. Here are my tasks:
```
Here are the tasks in your list:
1. [T][ ] read book
2. [D][ ] return book (by: Feb 15 2024)
3. [E][ ] NUS Career Fair (from: 21 Feb 2024 to: 29 Feb 2021)
```

## Marking status of tasks
You can mark the status of a task as **done** or **undone** by using the `mark` or `unmark` command .
To toggle your task, you can use the following commands:
* `mark {task number}` to mark that task as done.
* `unmark {task number}` to unmark that task as done.


### Example `mark` command
For example, to mark the **first** task in your task list as done, you can use the command:
```
mark 1
```

Klara will output:
```
Nice! I've marked this task as done:
[T][âœ˜] read book
```

### Example `unmark` command
To mark a task as undone, you can use the `unmark` command. 
You may notice that the task will no longer be crossed.
```
unmark 2
```

Klara will then output:
```
Nice! I've marked this task as undone:
[D][ ] return book (by: Feb 15 2024)
```

## Deleting tasks
You can delete a task by using the `delete` command.
```
delete {task number}
```

### Example `delete` command
To delete the **first** task in your task list, you can use the command:
```
delete 1
```

Klara will respond with the number of tasks remaining and the task that was deleted.
```
Noted. I've removed this task:
[T][ ] read book
Now you have 2 tasks in the list.
```

## Finding tasks
You can find tasks containing a specific **keyword** by using the `find` command
```
find {keyword}
```

### Example `find` command
To find tasks containing the keyword `book`, you can use the command:
```
find book
```

Klara will respond with the tasks that contain the keyword.
```
Here are the matching tasks in your list:
1. [T][ ] read book
2. [D][ ] return book (by: Feb 15 2024)
```

## Exiting the application
You can exit the application by using the `bye` command
```
bye
```

Klara will respond with a goodbye message and save your progress.
```
Bye. Hope to see you again soon!
```
