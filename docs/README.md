<img src="Ui.png" width="350">

Nicole is your smart task, deadline
and event manager! Give her commands using the formats
specified in this guide and 
look forward to easier days ahead :D

## Setting up

Skip to the basic guide if you need a little more help :hearts:

### Intermediate Guide
1. Ensure the version you are currently running is `Java 11` and switch if necessary.
   - Switching for [Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26993101/switching-between-different-jdk-versions-in-windows)
   - Switching for [Mac](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21964709/how-to-set-or-change-the-default-java-jdk-version-on-macos)
2. Follow from Step 2 of the Basic Guide!
   - :speaker: MacOS users, you may need to download a specific version of `Java` if you encounter issues
     launching Nicole. Simply follow from Step 1 of the Basic Guide in this scenario.


### Basic Guide

1. Download `Java 11`
   - For [Windows](https://arc.net/l/quote/xrxbvatl)
   - For MacOS (navigate to the "About This Mac" menu to find out which chip your mac has installed): 
     - [M1](https://arc.net/l/quote/rqjezudg)
     - [Intel](https://arc.net/l/quote/luolepqe)
2. Once you've downloaded `Java`, download the `Nicole.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/yashpola/ip/releases/tag/Level-10)
3. Navigate to your `downloads` directory and
   - Create a folder to put the `jar` file in
   - Double-click the `jar` file to launch Nicole. A window like the one shown below should open
   - Fire away!

Take note that when using Nicole, a `tasks.txt` file will
appear in your computer. This file will simply 
be used to save your items between sessions.

## Getting started

To know what basic commands Nicole can help you with, 
simply type-in `help` and you should see 
something like this:

![helpSS.png](helpSS.png)

Take note that when typing the actual commands, 
you should omit any square braces ([ ]) pictured above. 

You can find other helpful pointers below for a few of Nicole's commands.
Pay closer attention to the points marked with :writing_hand:!

## Adding an item

After adding an item in the following formats: 
1. `todo [task]`
2. `deadline [task] by YYYY-MM-DD`
3. `event [description] from YYYY-MM-DD at HH:MM:SS to YYYY-MM-DD at HH:MM:SS`

The item will appear in a `tasks.txt` file respectively in the following
formats: 
1. `[T][I] [task]`
2. `[D][I] [task] by YYYY-MM-DD`
3. `[E][I] [description] from YYYY-MM-DD at HH:MM:SS to YYYY-MM-DD at HH:MM:SS`

where `T, D, E` stand for `Todo`, `Deadline`, `Event` respectively
and `I` is the default status of the item
which is `Incomplete`.

## Marking, Unmarking, Deleting, and Updating items

Ensure you enter the correct item number for the item 
you are trying to `mark`, `unmark`, `delete` or `update`.
You can always ask Nicole to `list` 
first to check the items and their 
tasknumbers.

For example, if you wish to delete a `todo`, you
could `list`:

![list.png](listSS.png)

and then accordingly `delete 1` to see a confirmation:

![delete.png](deleteSS.png)

In this particular case since `borrow book` was the only
item, no items remained after deleting it.

:writing_hand: If you `mark` an item, its `I` status will change to `C` (meaning `Complete`). Vice versa for `unmark`.

## Adding Deadlines and Events

Take note!
- The specified formats of `by YYYY:MM:DD` for deadlines 
and `from YYYY:MM:DD at HH:MM:SS to YYYY:MM:DD at HH:MM:SS`
for events are strict! 

Potential triggers for errors :warning:
- For events specifically:
  - Adding events that overlap one another in any way
  - Specifying a `to...at` datetime for events that precedes the
    `from...at` datetime (for example, `event meeting from 2010-01-01...`)
- For both events and deadlines: 
  - Specifying date(time)s that precede the current date(time)

Nicole will indicate to you very clearly if you made 
any of the above errors and also guide you 
on how to rectify your command, so fret not!

:writing_hand: Updating an event could also lead to 
problems with clashing events. When in doubt, `list` to 
peruse your current items first.

## Sorting

`sort by date` will rearrange your list
of items from earliest to latest as per their date(time) like so:

![sort.png](sortByDateSS.png)

where events are sorted per their  `from` datetime. If an event's 
`from` date matches the date of a deadline, the event will
take precedence (such as items 2 and 3 above).

:writing_hand: Since `todos` do not have a datetime, they are ordered
**last** by default.

## Finally...
Remember to ***have fun*** with Nicole!
She will help you as much as possible in error and save your
item history for ease of repeated use.
