2. Deadline, tasks that have a single deadline.
3. Event, tasks that have a start date and end date.

## Adding tasks

### Adding Todo:
To add a Todo task, the syntax is todo taskname. For example, to add task "do 2103", one would enter ```todo do 2103```.

### Adding Deadline:
To add a Deadline task, the syntax is deadline /by date (mm/dd/yyyy format). For example, to add deadline "do 2103" by 23/2/2023, one would enter 
```deadline do 2103 /by 02/23/2023```. When listed, it will appear as "do 2103 (by: 2023-02-23)".

### Adding Event:
To add a Event task, the syntax is event /from startdate (mm/dd/yyyy format) /to enddate (mm/dd/yyyy format). For example, to add deadline "do 2103" from 23/2/2023 to 24/2/2023, one would enter ```event do 2103 /from 2/23/2023 /to 2/24/2023```. 
When listed, it will appear as "do 2103 (from: 2023-02-23 to 2023-02-24)".
