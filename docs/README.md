<br/>

### Sorting tasks

Format: `sortBy <ORDER>`

| Order             | Command                   | Result                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| date              | `sortBy date`             | Sorts your tasks by their dates. Tasks that are not time-sensitive, i.e., to-do tasks, will be sorted to the bottom of the list. Deadlines and events will be sorted by their deadline date and time, and start date and time respectively. |
| description       | `sortBy description`      | Sorts your tasks in ascending alphabetical order.                                                                                                     |
| type              | `sortBy type`             | Sorts your tasks by their type, starting from to-do tasks, then deadline tasks, and lastly event tasks.                                               |
| completed first   | `sortBy completed first`  | Sorts your completed tasks to the top of your task list.                                                                                               |
| incompleted first | `sortBy incompleted first` | Sorts your incompleted tasks to the top of your task list.                                                                                            |



<br/>

### Exiting Scribbles
Exits and closes the Scribbles. Your current list of tasks will be saved for the next time you run Scribbles again.

Format: `bye`

<br/>

## Additional notes
### Date time formats
Unfortunately, Scribbles currently only reads dates and time in the format `dd/MM/yyyy HHmm`.
This means that `02/10/2024 1700` is interpreted as 02 October 2024 5:00 p.m. by Scribbles.

> 🏷️ **NOTE**
> <br/>
> Don't worry if you find it hard to remember the accepted formatting! Scribbles will remind you and correct you as you
> use the program!

### Data-wiping
Deleting the file `scribblesData` created by Scribbles will wipe all data currently stored by Scribbles. This includes 
all tasks stored and their details. However, this does not affect the functioning of Scribbles.
If you wish to use Scribbles again, running Scribbles will create 
a new `scribblesData` file without any stored data and you can continue using Scribbles as normal.
