## Local storage
- chat stores all tasks in a local file, so that the tasks are not lost when the app is closed.
- the file is located at `data/tasks.txt` relative to the location of the jar file
- the file is created if it does not exist
- the file is updated every time a task is added, deleted, or marked as done
- the file is read every time the app is started, to load the tasks into the app
