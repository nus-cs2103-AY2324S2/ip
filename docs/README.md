# BobBot User Guide
## Introduction
BobBot is a little robot in a text application to help you manage your task!
He's friendly, happy, but slightly impatient and helps you to add different types of Task's, followed by marking and deleting them. He's even learnt how to sort now!
All these instructions will be provided below!
