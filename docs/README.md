# JerryGPT User Guide

Although not as powerful as ChatGPT, this application does manage your tasks with ease and unlike other programs which
have a strict limit on input format, users have the freedom of input format to some extent.

## Adding tasks

This allows you to add a new task to the program.

Example run: `todo Homework`

And you will see:
```
    Got it. I've added this task:
      [T][] Homework
```

You can add a task called deadline or event by changing the "todo" in the sample code. A deadline should have a deadline timestamp.
It is specified by a date followed a time point in a day. You have the freedom to specify the timestamp in a format you like,
as the product supports a lot of mainstream formats in English. Use `/by` to specify the deadline.
An Event is specified by two timestamps: a starting time and ending time. Use `/from` and `/to` to specify the both.

## Deleting a task

This allows you to delete a task you don't need to care anymore.

Example run: `delete 1`

And you will see:
```
    Noted. I've removed the task.
      [T][] Homework // from the previous run in "add"
```
Note that an index is needed to specify which task you wish to delete. If you type in an illegal index(smaller than 0 or larger than the number of tasks you have right now),
You will be notified, and your current existing tasks are safely stored.

## Exit

This tells you how to quit the program.

Example run: `bye` or type in `quit` or `goodbye`

And you will see:
```
  Bye! Please click the "X" on the upper right to exit. I'm happy to answer to your requests if you keep typing in!
```

## Find a task using a given keyword

With a given keyword, you can find the tasks that contain the certain keyword.

Example run: `find work` or `search work`

And you will see:
```
    Ok! The search results are as follows:
      [T][] Homework
```

The more you type in, the more likely you can find fewer tasks.

## list all tasks

Example run: `list`

And you will see:
```
    The results are as follows:
      [T][] Homework
```

This allows you to view the tasks you have right now.

## Marking and unmarking tasks

You can mark one event as done or undone.

Example run: `mark 1`

And you will see:
```
    Noted. I've marked this task as done:
      [T][X] Homework
```

Now we unmark it again as undone: `unmark 1`

And you will see:
```
    Noted. I've marked this task as not done yet:
      [T][] Homework
```

## Search the schedule on s specific date

You can view your schedule on a specific date by entering the command `view 2024-01-01`:

And you will see:
```
    OK! The search results are as follows:
    [T][] Homework
```

There are only Todo tasks now. Since they do not have a specific ending time, they will be added to the search results without further information.
For other events that have timestamp(s), they are organized in chronological order by the starting time or deadline, not in the order they are added.
