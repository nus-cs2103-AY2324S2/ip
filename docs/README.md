## FAQ
1. Where can I check your Github page?
Q: You can click [here](https://github.com/jinhanfromNUS/ip)

2. What is the date format? Why is my date format wrong?
Q: Date format should be XXXX-XX-XX (e.g. 2023-01-01). This only applies for entering the date format.

3. Why is my date not working?
Q: The date format in your list and the date format while adding deadline/event tasks is different.
   Adding tasks: YYYY-MM-DD
   Output List: DDMMMYYYY

4. Why is my *delete* / *mark as done* / *mark as not done* not working?
Q: Please check the task index, it could likely to be invalid task index. You can enter `list` or `/ls` to check the index for each tasks.

5. Why deadline and event tasks even work without a description?
Q: That is not a bug! It is meant to be like that. Sometimes, you just need a date to remind you about your remaining tasks :).

6. Do I need to create a separate database while using this application?
Q: No! It is totally fine if there is no database upon using this application. The application will create a text file called **tasklist.txt** store all your tasks.
   **tasklist.txt** will be in the same directory as your jar file.

## Future Updates
I will be adding more features, such as mass delete and mass marking. Besides, I will also enhance the GUI of the application. Moreover, I will try to make customizable available, so that you can customize your own bot name and theme!

## How does it look like?
