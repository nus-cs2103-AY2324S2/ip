# William User Guide

William is a **desktop application designed for managing tasks such as to-dos, events, and deadlines.** Optimized for use via the Command Line Interface (CLI), it features a One Piece theme, catering to fans of One Piece or anime in general. If you're a fast typist, William can track your tasks more swiftly than Luffy's journey to becoming the King of Pirates—a saga so lengthy, it's hard to keep up with.

## Quick Start
1. Ensure that you have Java `11` or above installed on your Computer
2. Download the latest `William.jar` from [here](https://github.com/KhoonSun47/ip/releases)
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your William
4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar William.jar` command to run the application. A GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing `list` and pressing enter will show you the list of tasks.<br>
   ![Ui](./Ui.png)
   Some example commands you can try
    - `list`: Lists all the tasks.
    - `todo cs2103 assignment`: Add a todo with a description of the cs2103 assignment to your list of tasks.
    - `delete 3`: Deletes the 3rd task in the list.
    - `bye`: Exits the application.
6. Refer to [Features](#features) below for details of each command

## Features
ℹ️ Notes about the command format:
- Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `todo DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter that can be used as `todo play games`.
- Parameters must be in fixed order.<br>
  e.g. in `event DESCRIPTION /from FROM_DATE /to TO_DATE`, `FROM_DATE` must always be before `TO_DATE`.
- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
  as space characters surrounding line breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Saving the data
William's data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file
William's data is saved automatically as a `.txt` file `[JAR file location]/data/tasks.txt`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

### Caution
If your changes to the data file make its format invalid (e.g. adding a new field), William will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it. 
<br>

However, if your changes to the data file interfere with the syntax (e.g. changing the `DATE` format, or adding a new `PRIORITY_LEVEL`), William will not detect this and it will lead to errors when using the application (This feature could be added in during a new version).
<br>

Furthermore, certain edits can cause William to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ
Q: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
A: Install the app on the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous William home folder.
