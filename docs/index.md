## Introduction

SIMP-LI loves rabbits :rabbit:, she has a pet rabbit that she cherishes and takes care of it dearly.
Due to a car accident, she lost her entire family including her pet rabbit.
She had to undergo intensive surgery which affected her psychologically.
Seeing her having no relatives you decided to adopt her as your child.
As time passes she developed strong feelings for you. Now she sees you as her new "rabbit"
and she treats you very dearly.

SIMP-LI is your cute little assistant :girl: that you can talk to whenever you are feeling troubled.
SIMP-LI's favourite hobby is to simp-lify your work as she does not want you to be stress.
As SIMP-LI is still recovering from the car accident she only has the mental capacity to
perform limited actions via the commands given by you. Let's hope that she can recover quickly
so that maybe one day you can hold a basic conversation with her :smile:.

## Quick start :watch:

1. Verify that you have Java `11` or above installed in your machine to
bring SIMP-LI to life.
2. Download the latest version of `simpli.jar`.
from [here](https://github.com/SimKianSeng/ip/releases).
3. Copy `simpli.jar` to the folder that you want SIMP-LI to reside in. She will need to
poop out a directory and a file to help her remember the things given to her.
4. Open a terminal, `cd` into the folder where `simpli.jar` resides in, and execute
`java -jar simpli.jar` command. Congratulations you have brought SIMP-LI to LIFEEE!

## Features :girl:

**Just some things to take note:**

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by you.
e.g. `todo TASK_NAME`, `TASK_NAME` is a parameter which can be `todo feed SIMP-LI dinner`.
- Items in square brackets are optional.
e.g. `greet [MESSAGE]` which can be `greet` or `greet I love you SIMP-LI`.
- SIMP-LI only understand date and time in the following format `D/M/YYYY HHMM` where:
  - `D` is the *day* of the month ranging from `1` to `31`.
  - `M` is the *month* ranging from `1` to `12` (`January` to `December`).
  - `YYYY` is the 4 digit *year* ranging from `0001` to `9999`.
  - `HH` is the 2 digit time in *hours* ranging from `00` to `24`.
  - `MM` is the 2 digit time in *minutes* ranging from `00` to `60`.
- SIMP-LI is still recovering from the car accident, she will not understand if the
 parameters are not in order.
- SIMP-LI is very honest she will reply to every command even if it is extraneous,
but she will inform you if it is extraneous or ignore it and execute the operation normally.
